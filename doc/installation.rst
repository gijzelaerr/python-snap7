Snap7
-----

To use python-snap7 you need to have the snap7 library installed.

~~~~~~

If you are using Ubuntu you can use the Ubuntu packages from our
`launchpad PPA <https://launchpad.net/~gijzelaar/+archive/snap7>`_. To install::

    $ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gijzelaar/snap7
    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install libsnap7-1 libsnap7-dev

Windows
~~~~~~~

Download the zip file from the
`sourceforce page <http://sourceforge.net/projects/snap7/files/>`_.
Unzip the zip file, and copy* release\Windows\<Win64/Win32>\snap7.dll* somewhere
in you system PATH, for example *C:\WINDOWS\system32*. Alternatively you can
copy the file somewhere on your file system and adjust the system PATH.


Compile from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are not using Ubuntu or if you want to have more control you can
download the latest source from
`the sourceforce page <http://sourceforge.net/projects/snap7/files/>`_ and do
a manual compile. Download the file and run::

     $ p7zip -d snap7-full-1.0.0.7z  # requires the p7 program
     $ cd build/<platform>           # where platform is unix or windows
     $ make -f <arch>.mk install     # where arch is your architecture, for example x86_64_linux
