Introduction
============

python-snap7 is a Python wrapper for the
`Snap7 library <https://snap7.sourceforge.net>`_. Snap7 is an open source,
32/64 bit, multi-platform Ethernet communication suite for interfacing natively
with Siemens S7 PLCs.

Python-snap7 is developer for snap7 1.1.0 and Python 3.7+. It is tested
on Windows (10 64 bit), OSX 10.15 and Linux, but it may work on other operating
systems. Python Versions <3.7 may work, but is not supported anymore.

The project development is centralized on `github <https://github.com/gijzelaerr/python-snap7>`_.
